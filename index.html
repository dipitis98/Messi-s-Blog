                <p>Lionel Andrés Messi, born on June 24, 1987 in Rosario, Argentina, is widely regarded as one of the
                    greatest
                    footballers of all time. Known for his extraordinary dribbling, vision, playmaking, and goal-scoring
                    ability, Messi has redefined the sport over the last two decades. <br>
                    From his early days at Newell’s Old Boys in Argentina, to his legendary career at FC Barcelona, and
                    later
                    spells at Paris Saint-Germain and Inter Miami, Messi’s journey has inspired millions. Beyond club
                    football,
                    he became a national hero by leading Argentina to win the Copa América in 2021 and the FIFA World
                    Cup in
                    2022. <br>
                    Messi is not only a record-breaking athlete with multiple Ballon d’Or awards but also a global icon
                    whose
                    legacy extends beyond the pitch.</p>
